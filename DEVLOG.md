# DEVLOG - AI Job Application Agent

This document tracks notable implementation milestones and technical decisions.

## Day 1: Project Setup and Resume Parsing

- Initialized the repository, virtual environment, license, and Streamlit shell.
- Added an MVP navigation flow covering resume upload, LinkedIn import, job search, and manual JD input.
- Chose lightweight parsing dependencies first:
  - `pypdf`
  - `python-docx`

## Day 2: Demo Inputs and Unified File Parsing

- Added sample resumes and sample job descriptions under `static/`.
- Updated parsing code so both uploaded files and local demo files work through the same logic.
- Added basic job-description cleaning and simple extraction for title, location, experience, and skills.

## Day 3: LinkedIn Import and Session Persistence

- Added LinkedIn data-export ZIP ingestion instead of direct LinkedIn API access.
- Parsed summary, education, skills, preferences, publications, and position history where present.
- Stored parsed payloads in `st.session_state` so the UI survives navigation and reruns.

## Day 4: Repo Structure Alignment With GitHub Agent

- Moved the active application logic into `src/`.
- Refactored `app.py` into a cleaner Streamlit entrypoint with section-level render functions.
- Added parser-focused tests under `tests/`.
- Added `docs/architecture.md`, ADR files under `docs/adr/`, a roadmap, and a real README.
- Improved parsing behavior:
  - TXT resumes are now supported
  - job-description cleanup preserves line breaks
  - JD source persistence now stores parsed text instead of the raw uploaded file object

## Day 5: Modular UI and Defensive Parser Refactor

- Reduced root `app.py` to a thin entrypoint and moved UI composition into `src/ui/`.
- Split the codebase into clearer layers:
  - `src/parsers/` for raw ingestion and extraction
  - `src/services/` for normalization and deterministic workflow helpers
  - `src/ui/` for Streamlit theme, components, navigation, and pages
- Kept top-level parser modules as compatibility wrappers so existing imports and tests continue to work.
- Added `ResumeDocument` to the shared schemas and started using typed objects more consistently in the UI.
- Hardened parser behavior with more defensive checks:
  - explicit empty-file handling
  - clearer unsupported-format failures
  - safer PDF and DOCX open failures
  - better LinkedIn ZIP validation and normalization
- Verified the refactor with:
  - `venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest`
  - `venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall app.py src tests`
